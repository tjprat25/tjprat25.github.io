            Internship at Dassault Systemes (Summer 2023 and 2024)

        <p class = "fade-element">
            For two summers I interned for the SOLIDWORKS Partner Program in Waltham, MA. I gained experience working in a corporate, team-based environment. I was responsible for quality assurance of our team's databases, and organization of standard operating files/resources, which helped improve the team's quality-of-life.

                    This report served as a cumulative assessment for my Statistical Modeling class. It involved heavy amounts of R coding, and communicating my results to a professional audience, without showing any of my code. The primary question I was tasked with answering was whether or not there was an association between birdkeeping and lung cancer. I computed and provided appropriate summary statistics, and created a model predicting lung cancer status from birdkeeping status. I found that there was a strong relationship between the two variables, even after controlling for confounding variables.

                    This project was part of my Programming Languages class, and used both C and Java. Each task in the project had a relatively simple premise (counting digits or applying a filter to an image) but were implemented using several different methods of parallelism. Specifically, trials used different amounts of mutexes and threads, and runtimes were compared.

                    This project was part of my Data Analysis and Visualization Class, and used numpy in Python. The first steps of the project involved coding the functions for the RBF Network by practicing k-means classification and linear regression on smaller datasets. After this, the remainder of the project focused on refining the network, and then using it. After preprocessing the image data, I trained the network with 60,000 images of handwritten digits, then tested how well it could identify new images. The result was an accuracy of around 90%.

                    This project was part of my Data Structures and Algorithms class. It was one of several projects that involved analyzing word counts from comments posted on Reddit over many years. This iteration of the project used Heaps and PriorityQueues to optimize run-time. Previous iterations utilized Binary Search Trees and HashMaps. Beyond just providing word counts, this project involved analyzing the trends of words relating to certain themes across several years (including technology, sports and politics).
