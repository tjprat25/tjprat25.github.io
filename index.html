        <p class = "fade-element">
            For two summers I interned for the SOLIDWORKS Partner Program in Waltham, MA. I gained experience working in a corporate, team-based environment. I was responsible for quality assurance of our team's databases, and organization of standard operating files/resources, which helped improve the team's quality-of-life.
